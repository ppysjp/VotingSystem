I've just decided to watch the video from beginning because it has 
been a month since I last looked at this stuff.
The point of Entity Framework means that you don't have to write sql. 
You can instead use the Framework and it will write your sql for you.
The DbContext is a wrapper for your data.
An AppDbContext is a set of tables that is wrapped by your DbContext.
The Fruit class represents a table for example.
A DbSet is a collection with rows.
So DbSet<Fruit> is a collection of fruit with a load of instances of fruit.
You should look at the Interfaces this class implements.
A DbSet allows you to generate queries.
You use linq to make queries to your database context.
In this example we are going to use the InMemory database nuget package
which will allow use to use a fake database.
If you type Alt-Enter in the body of the AppDbContext and then select
GenerateOverrides...
You deselect everything and then override the OnCofiguring method.
Because we are going to tell the AppDbContext and we are going to 
use the UseInMemoryDatabase which is a function that is now available 
because we have added the nuget package for it.
