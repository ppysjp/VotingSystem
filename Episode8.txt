We begin by tidying up everything that we have made so far in the CounterManagerTests.cs 
file. If you type Alt-Enter where a class is defined then you can get a menu up for 
reorganising your code.
You can use Add New File using shift F2.
We've basically moved the "Data" object which is in this case the Counter object and have 
moved it the models folder. This has meant we have needed to go around the places where we 
are getting errors and have needed to use Alt-Enter in order to tell the program where to 
get various parts. We have done this by using Alt-Enter on any bit of code that has had 
red squiggle underneath it.
