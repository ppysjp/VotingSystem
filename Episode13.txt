Instead of a having a code block for every single route for the webapplication that we are 
making, we are going to make use of the MVC architecture. This means that we are going to 
make use of a controlle to manage the routing for us instead.

So to do this we are going to make use of the MapDefaultControllerRoute Method.

So we are now going to implement the controller. There are a set of conventions that are 
required to make a controller. So to do the next step we are going to create a Controller
folder within the Api project and the we are going to make a class with 'Controller' as 
its suffix that inherits from Controller.

So yeah that's cool we now have a Controller for the HomePage of the Website.
