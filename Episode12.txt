In this episode we take a lot of steps gain domain knowledge for what a WebApplication is actually doing. 

gacp "Episode12 first commit"

We are going to build a webserver that is an ASP.Net Core WebApplication. So we add a project
to our solution which is called VotiingSystem.UI.

gacp "Add ASP.Net Core WebApplication to Project"

So we now spend some time looking at hte differences between the VotingSystem.Appplication.csproj
and the VotingSystem.UI.csproj. The main thing he point out is that the project tag are diffent.

The Application has the following tag

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

wheras the Web.UI has this tag

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

This enables the projec to have access to a load of tools that would otherwise be unavailable.

gacp "Looking at the differences between csproj files"

So it's at this stage that we start looking at the Main program file. 
The first thing that stares you in the face is the CreateHostBuilder functon. 
This is making use of the Builder pattern which I think may be worth a quick read so I'm 
just going to do that.

Builder patter is a compext object that allows you to make complicated objects.

Just spent some time studying how everything plugs together. So I think a
Host is a pretty complex object which is why the method CreateHostBuilder is called for it. 

He then explains how the application works. So a request goes into the application and then
there is a middleware layer that the request has to get past first, before the requestt we 
are making then interacts with the main logic of the application that we have been building.

There are two very important functions. 

There is the Configure function and the is the ConfigureServices function. 

The Configure function manages the middleware. 

Within the Configure method the app.UseEndpoints method is called with the action 
MapRazorPages being called. 

The key thing to notice is there is an app builder. So we have used 2 builders to build up 
quite complex objects in this case! An application builder and a hostbuilder. Interesting.

gacp "Learning about how the Configure function works within the Startup.cs"

I think he basically is now explaining how request and responses work.
So he is saying that the request comes in  within the Configure method and the response goes
out. And he says that once the response has been made it is immutable. 

He shows that when you opoen the devtools and then look at the Network tab and refresh, if you
place the 201 response before hello world then the Status is 201. 

gacp "Place 201 response before helloworld"

This time the response is 200 when we put the 201 resonse to be after the call. 

gacp "Place 201 response after helloworld"

So once we have Written to the repsonse we can no longer make changes to it, that is the 
key thing that he trying to enforce. 

The thing he is getting across is that once the response is written to, IT IS IMMUTABLE!!!
Your code will compile in C# but that doesn't mean that it's correct.

gacp "Responses are immutable"

So now we are going to make a CustomMiddleWare. The interesting thing about this 
object is that by convention it is designed for passiing around functional arguments 
which is something that you learned in SICP and are very comfortable with the concept of :)

gacp "Begin creating a custom middleware"

We then implement the constructor and the Invocation. And then we add the usage of the middleware
to the Configure method. 

We've also just got a technique for chaing a load of nested methods in an elegant way. 

gacp "Implement the custom middleware"

The buisness Logic will be registered as services and then injected into the project.
