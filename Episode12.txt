So we now spend some time looking at hte differences between the VotingSystem.Appplication.csproj
and the VotingSystem.UI.csproj. The main thing he point out is that the project tag are diffent.

The Application has the following tag

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
