So we begin adding some more services that our VotingSystem.UI is going to use.

gacp "Begin Episode 15, partially add new services to the VotingSystemUI startup"

We are using AddScoped. Add scoped is the lifetime of the service, a singleton is created
once and then is the same every time it is called. A description of the different services 
is given if you search Stack Overflow for the following: 

AddTransient, AddScoped and AddSingleton Services Differences

- Singleton which creates a single instance throughout the application. 
		It creates the instance for the first time and reuses the same object in the all calls.

- Scoped lifetime services are created once per request within the scope. 
		It is equivalent to a singleton in the current scope. For example, 
		in MVC it creates one instance for each HTTP request, 
		but it uses the same instance in the other calls within the same web request.

- Transient lifetime services are created each time they are requested. 
		This lifetime works best for lightweight, stateless services.

When to use:

Transient
---------

since they are created every time they will use more memory & Resources and can have the negative impact on performance
use this for the lightweight service with little or no state.

Scoped
------

better option when you want to maintain state within a request.

Singleton
---------

memory leaks in these services will build up over time.
also memory efficient as they are created once reused everywhere.

We need to move the IVotingSystemPersistance out of the Application section of our
project and move it into the VotingSystem itself. This helps maintain the modularity
of our system, but will mean that we need to inject the Interface into the Application
at some point. So we have now said that the VotingSystemDatabase is dependant on the
the VotingSystem project which has now caused the project references to have errors.

We also need to register the service that is the AppDbContext. This will be injected
into the VotingSystemPersistance as the VotingSystemPersistance is depedendent upon 
this.

We need to specify where we are gonig to store the data, this time round we will use 
the in memory database again for now but it would normally be at this stage that you 
use an SQL provider. You can see how this is implemented in the DbContextFactory. 
However for the UI we can call the function that will mkae use of the InMemoryDatabase. 
He then explains the functional paradigm of C#.

10:10 Let's see if we can undertand this at another stage.

The next step is to inject the votingPollInteractor into the Index.cshtml.cs file.

For this application because it is small we are going to tightly couple the database 
with the Database. This is just a shortcut and shouldn't be done normally. 
If we want to do things properly we should use the persistence layer that we have
created and go down the formal road. But for now this will do.
This technically has broken our architecture.
If we are just displaying straight from the database one thing then this is a fine 
thing to do because this is a small application.
