So we are going to do a deep dive into our votingpoll interactor. 
We are going to upgrade the application so that it records a vote, there is going to be a 
set of logic which dicates how and whether a vote is going to be recorded to the database 
so most of the changes will be made to the VotingPollInteractor.
