So we are going to do a deep dive into our votingpoll interactor. 
We are going to upgrade the application so that it records a vote, there is going to be a 
set of logic which dicates how and whether a vote is going to be recorded to the database 
so most of the changes will be made to the VotingPollInteractor.

gacp "First commit for Episode10"

So we are now going to start with the simplest step which is just to get a Vote saving to the 
database. To do this we are going to add a class to VotingSystem.Application.Tests which 
will have a class which will test the VotingInteractor.

gacp "Created first test for saving a vote to the database"

So it's important to pont out that the votinginteractor is not the same thing as the 
votingpollinteractor. 
The second thing is we know that we are going to need to use the persistance layer to 
do the testing so we use the mock persistance layer that we use in the VotingPollInteractorTests.cs
here as well.

Cool.

The other thing we have done is alse create 2 new classes. The first class we have created 
is the Vote class and the next class we have created is called the VotingInteractor.

gacp "Create Vote and VotingInteractor objects"

So we have now started to make further in roads into the test we are creating. We want to
make sure that when the interactor calls Vote function it will then cause the persistance 
layer to make a call to the SaveVote function. So that is what we are implementing next.

We have partially implemented the fact that the  persistance layer being called when the 
interactor calls Vote but we have compilation errors still that need to be fixed.

gacp "Ensure interactor calls persistance SaveVote when Vote is called"

Ok so the Vote class is actually part of the Model so we need to move the class to the Model
folder and then change the namespace etc where it is found. We are doing this so that 
we can get rid of the compilation errros we are facing at the moment.

So we now do the next task of making the test pass and then we begin adding more complex 
logic surround when a vote can be persisted and when it can't. This is done by beginning the 
next test, so let's now do that.
